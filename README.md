# Fender Digital Data Engineering Exercise

Design and implement a data pipeline that populates a small reporting database. The expectation is that we will end up with a transformed data set which provides us the ability to answer the questions asked by our theoretical analyst.

MovieLens -> https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/


# User Story
As an analyst I would like to create a report to understand what movies our users have rated. My report would be able to:
* show an average rating for each movie 
* show average ratings by gender
* show average rating by occupation

# ReadMe
Please include:
* a readme file that explains your thinking
* a data model showing your design, explain why you designed the reporting db that way and include the DDL used to generate the tables in your database
* how to run and set up your project (database and data pipeline)
* if you have tests, include instructions on how to run them
* a description of:
	* enhancements you might make
	* additional features you have added to help with future reporting needs
* questions you have
* recommendations for us


# Additional Info:
* we expect that this will take you an hour or more to complete
* use any langugage or framework you are comfortable with we prefer Python
* Feel free to use whichever database you'd like; we suggest Postgres.
* Bonus points for security, specs, etc.
* Do as little or as much as you like.

Please fork this repo and commit your code into that fork. Show your work and process through those commits.
